# UFOs

## Overview:
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I’ll be tasked to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. I'll also update the app.js to work accordingly. 

### Resources: 
  - Javascript ES6, HTML, CSS 
  - D3.js Javascript library, (data.js file supplied)
  - VSCode1.56
  
### Objective:
###### Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

###### Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

### Results:
#### In order for the end-user to filter or search for data. The user will need to make an input into the search criteria. To activate the filter, the user will then press 'Enter' to intitiate the search. (Image of input tables below)

#### Once the search has been made, a successfully filtered table will appear matching the result of the user input. (Image of sucessful search below.)

### Summary:
Although I successfully completed the tasks for Dana's challenge I did find a drawback to the deliverable. 

The drawback would be in the "shape" criteria. The 'shapes' that are available in the data.js file would be difficult for new users to the website to make a proper search. Due to lack of information and options on types of shapes that the user can input . Users would have trouble finding the correct input for that particular search criteria in order for the filter to function properly.
The "shape" in the data could probably be left out of the search criteria.

With that being said, the two additional recommendations for future development I'd make to the Dana's webpage would be:

  -  Adding a dropdown list to the input tables so the user can search through an active list that matches the data. (example: when inputting for a shape it'll dropdown a list of available shapes to choose from for input).
  
  -  Adding an active community forum for users to discuss the topics of UFO sightings and conspiracies.
